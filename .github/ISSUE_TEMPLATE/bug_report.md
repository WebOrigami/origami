**Bugs are a lousy way to say hello.** If you haven't already done so, please introduce yourself to [Jan Miksovsky](https://jan.miksovsky.com/contact.html) and say hello first!

Begin with a clear and concise description of the bug.

**Steps that reproduce the issue**

- It's extremely helpful if you can identify a [minimal reproduction case](https://github.com/WebOrigami/origami/blob/main/Contributing.md#identifying-a-minimal-reproduction-case).
- When possible, please post a link to source code.
- Please use the plainest code possible to reproduce the issue. It's not feasible for bug investigators to install and learn new libraries, frameworks, languages, etc., just to investigate a single bug.

**Expected behavior**

A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
